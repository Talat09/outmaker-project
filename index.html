        <h1>#1: CREATE VISUAL VIGNETTES.</h1>
        <p>
          Approach your open kitchen shelves in the same way you would a
          bookshelf and consider them to be curiosity cabinets filled with
          meaningful objects that catch your eye and add a hint of sentiment to
          your style.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>#2: CONSIDER SCALE AND VERTICALITY.</h1>
        <p>
          Pair objects in various heights and shapes to encourage the eye to
          travel along the open shelf. Stack plates in uneven piles next to an
          abstract art piece that’s leaning against the wall followed by a
          vintage vessel with branches that add height and a statuesque quality.
          Keep moving things around until the right combination sticks.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>#3: ORIENT EACH SHELF DIFFERENTLY.</h1>
        <p>
          If you have more than one shelf, style them in slightly different ways
          to create a subtle offbeat design that allows for a perfectly
          imperfect finish. If it’s feeling too perfect, adjust your pieces so
          they are slightly uneven, and ditch the symmetry for irregularity.
          Just like the aged patina of an old clay vessel, there is always
          beauty in the blemishes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>#4: TAKE PHOTOS TO ASSESS AND REASSESS YOUR PROGRESS.</h1>
        <p>
          If you’re feeling overwhelmed, take a step back and photograph your
          open kitchen shelves on your iPhone. The gaps or flat spots will be
          immediately visible when you can assess the open shelf design as an
          entire tableau. Then you can make adjustments, tweak the styling, and
          add that finishing touch you were missing.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>#5: DON’T FORGET YOUR FOCAL POINT.</h1>
        <p>
          Fusing aesthetic eras and styles will enliven your open-shelf design
          just as it does a room, but you will lose your vision without a focal
          point or anchor. Setting the scene with a neutral foundation helps to
          bring much-needed cohesion to the space. On Calderone’s marble
          shelves, a trifecta of 1950s Italian wall lamps can live alongside a
          curvy wrought-iron lamp with a rattan shade because the shelves are
          grounded in similar shades, hues, and tones that unify them.
